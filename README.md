# Celtic-knot
An html-based implementation of the celtic-knot puzzles

Celtic knot is one of the puzzles from the Treasure Trail, a Distraction and Diversion minigame of RuneScape MMORPG.
Within the original game, a player need to solve a real-life celtic knot puzzle by making the knot have rotational symmetery. The player can move the elements (runestones in game) on a loop in the desired direction, and player can also 'flip' the puzzle to reveal the runestones hidden under intersections. If all the runestones in the intersections are matched, the knot can be unlocked to finish the game and open the scroll box.

The puzzle is now regenerated from RuneScape into web-based form where all the graphics and simulations are performed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including the libraries and frameworks). Please take a look on this work and share your comments.
